# NIXVER
![screenshot](ss.png)

Nixver is Window's winver like program that shows basic system information. It should work on all unix like operating system such as linux or bsd. I've tested it on Ubuntu and ArchLinux so idk how it is on other distros. 

# How to use it
* First, install python and pygobject `sudo apt install python3 python-gobject`
* Next, clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/patrykolczak/nixver`
* Finally enter to directory `cd nixver` and run program `python3 nixver.py`

# To do
Can someone help me with setting proper logo? I want to grab logo file from somewhere in the filesystem, beacuse I don't want to store a lot of `.png` files in repo.
